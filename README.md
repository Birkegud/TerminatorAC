# TerminatorAC
### What is TerminatorAC?
TerminatorAC have been developed since January 2021. It stared as a meme however over time has it turned into a project. Our anticheat can block Lua injections as well as many other injections. We have tried out best to completely block big menus like Fallout and Dopamine.

### Todo
* Major Config Update (Next update SOON&trade;)
* Better Standard Config (Next update SOON&trade;)
* Better Detentions
* Recode/Optimize the code

### Setup
#### Important:
* Remember to **make a backup** of the server before doing any of the installation steps
* Change name of Resource (To reduce the chance of cheaters finding it)
* Configure the webhooks
#### Optional:
* Configure the config to your liking
* Obfuscate the code (I recommend using [IronBrew](https://obfuscator.aztupscripts.xyz/) or [XOR](http://obfuscate.filesecuring.com/))

##### Step By Step:
###### Resource Installation:
* After you have configured the config to your liking. Rename the current resourcename to something like "BetterClouds" (It's very important you choose something that isn't obvious).

###### Installation in every resource:
* Do ```/Term:Install All``` in the console to install in every resource to prevent any execution.
* To Uninstall from every resource do ```/Term:Uninstall All```
